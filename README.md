Create a React application that displays a table of song information and metrics. The user should be able to sort the order of songs by the various columns.

Rules:

1. Do **not** use table elements (table, th, tr, td, ...)
2. Include any necessary CSS  but it doesn't need to be pretty.
3. Allow the user to scroll vertically and horizontally through columns and rows that can't be displayed.
