Create a React application that shows a table of songs with their information and metrics displayed by column (each row is a song, each column is a song attribute).

Requirements:

1. Take the included song data file, use an AWS SAM CLI and a node.js lambda function to serve the frontend with the data.
2. Do **not** use table elements (table, th, tr, td, ...).
3. Include any necessary CSS but it doesn't need to be pretty.
4. Allow the user to scroll vertically and horizontally through columns and rows that go off screen.
5. Allow the user to sort the order of the song rows by the column values.
